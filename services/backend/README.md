# Backend

The Backend service is the backbone of the entire application.

It is a Feathers.js-based REST API that handles everything relating to storing or retrieving persistent data.

Everything relating to the domain model is ultimately settled here in the Backend, since only the Backend has access to the Postgres database.

# Tech Stack

- Language: JavaScript/Node
- API Framework: Express + Feathers.js
- ORM: Sequelize

# Interactions with Other Services

The following explains how the Backend service interacts with the other Skillhub services.

## Frontend

The Frontend calls the Backend for all manner of things (i.e. CRUD) relating to the data models.

It also relies on the Backend for JWT authentication.

The Frontend passes a JWT on all authenticated requests (i.e. pretty much everything except login/signup) to access restricted resources.

## Predictions

The Predictions service gets called by the Backend to perform predictions for contributors and skills (i.e. whether or not a person is a 'contributor' for a project, and whether or not a person has a skill).

The Predictions service then returns the predicted results and the Backend persists them.

## Scraper

The Scraper (more specifically, the Scraper workers) call the Backend to pass it either the scraped issue data from Jira or the commit logs data from Bitbucket.

The Backend then processes the raw data or sends it off to the Predictions service for processing + predictions.

# Secrets

The following are the secrets stored in `service-secrets.zip` (or `.env.encrypted`). These are exposed to the service as environment variables.

- PREDICTIONS_API_KEY: An arbitrary string used as an API key for the Predictions service. Must match the Predictions service's `SKILLHUB_API_KEY`.
- SCRAPER_API_KEY: An arbitrary string used as an API key for the Scraper service. Must match the Scraper service's `SKILLHUB_API_KEY`.
- TOKEN_SECRET: Secret used by Feathers for the JWT tokens.
